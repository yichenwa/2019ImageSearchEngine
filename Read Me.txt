How to test the codeBefore running the code, it needs to change the path of images on your machine. --Changing the path to ‘/paris’: line #28--Set sample image for test: line#17	(You can also split any small objects in a random image as a sample image)--Changing the threshold: line #73	(I set it 15, means only analyses the image has more than 15 matched key points with sample image. You can change this value because a small sample image may have small key points.)--Output n images after ranking: line #99, #110	(I set it output the first 10 best matched images, you can change this to whatever you like.)
